  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I am a seasoned SDET who most recently worked at OvationCXM, a customer experience management platform, with
    over
    two years of experience in creating and maintaining automated test suites, frameworks, and integrations
    using
    Playwright, TypeScript, and various tools. I have a strong network security, linguistics, gaming, and
    philosophy
    background, and have held CompTIA A+, Net+, and QIR certifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    My passion is to align human interaction with technology by ensuring the quality, reliability, and
    accessibility of
    software products. I have successfully migrated the end-to-end tests from Cypress to Playwright, reducing
    runtime by
    85%, and incorporated accessibility standards into our design and testing via WCAG, Axe/Arc, and project
    A11y. I
    have also contributed to the test automation community by sharing my expertise and best practices through
    blogs,
    podcasts, and webinars. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a
    software
    craftsman.
  </p>
  <p>
    Developer Proficiency:
    I navigate through Typescript, Playwright, and various automation frameworks adroitly. Drawing from my
    diverse experiences in early-stage start-ups, I've refined a skill set that aligns with my strategic
    perspective, using both to guide projects to success.
    Having authored and maintained a ~40k LoC Playwright automation project for an 8-year-old distributed web
    app stack, I understand the practical day-to-day of a tester and a developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Strategic Outlook:
    Recognizing that organizational failures often stem from a lack of alignment, my primary focus is to bridge
    those divides strategically and ensure a united vision. I constantly look for the smallest change with the
    biggest impact, whether that be writing new test coverage, drafting documentation to deconstruct silos, or
    bringing data and perspective to the people that need it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personal Interests:
    For professional growth, I am currently learning Rust, C++, Tauri, and SurrealDb to broaden my skill set.
    When I'm not coding, I'm chatting with friends on Discord while running content in WoW or FFXIV, clearing my
    unplayed Steam backlog, or practicing a song from Stronghold on the mandolin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Craftsmanship Adherent:
    A proud supporter of the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto, I pursue quality and professionalism in all my
    work.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am actively seeking opportunities that align with my passion for software design, development, and QA
    automation. If you like what you see here, reach out and say hello!
