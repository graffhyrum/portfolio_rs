    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Greetings, weary traveler! I am a software craftsman driven by a blend of test automation proficiency, a
      background in linguistics, gaming, and philosophy, and a steadfast commitment to harmonizing human
      interaction with technology. My journey thus far has been characterized by a focus on test automation,
      process documentation, and getting information from where it is to where it needs to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developer Proficiency:
      I navigate through Typescript, Playwright, and various automation frameworks adroitly. Drawing from my
      diverse experiences in early-stage start-ups, I've refined a skill set that aligns with my strategic
      perspective, using both to guide projects to success.
      Having authored and maintained a ~40k LoC Playwright automation project for an 8-year-old distributed web
      app stack, I understand the practical day-to-day of a tester and a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strategic Outlook:
      Recognizing that organizational failures often stem from a lack of alignment, my primary focus is to bridge
      those divides strategically and ensure a united vision. I constantly look for the smallest change with the
      biggest impact, whether that be writing new test coverage, drafting documentation to deconstruct silos, or
      bringing data and perspective to the people that need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal Interests:
      For professional growth, I am currently learning Rust, C++, Tauri, and SurrealDb to broaden my skill set.
      When I'm not coding, I'm chatting with friends on Discord while running content in WoW or FFXIV, clearing my
      unplayed Steam backlog, or practicing a song from Stronghold on the mandolin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craftsmanship Adherent:
      A proud supporter of the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto, I pursue excellence in the nuanced art of
      software development with a measured and deliberate approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am actively seeking opportunities that align with my passion for software design, development, and QA
      automation. If you like what you see here, reach out and say hello!
