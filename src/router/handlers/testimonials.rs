Integrity and team spirit
Going above and beyond
Work ethic and significant contributions

Josh has performed his duties with exemplary work ethic and teamwork. He also went above and beyond and made significant contributions to TRAY:

He helped resolve Rush Fun Parkâ€™s numerous issues by spending multiple days on-site monitoring, replacing and fixing hardware as well as providing network configuration assistance. This resulted in a successful customer testimonial video.

Josh introduced and helped implement multiple key tools and processes we use every day including Trello which we use for on-boarding.

Josh is actively involved in our documentation efforts and is the first person to update existing documents when something changes or create content like in-depth video guides for large product features.

Josh submitted more product enhancements to JIRA than anyone else including great detail and UI examples."
